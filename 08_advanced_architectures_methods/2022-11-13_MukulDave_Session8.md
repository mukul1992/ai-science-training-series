## Homework 8

Since my field is fluid dynamics and I have been dealing with turbulent flow, I would love to explore the area of data-driven modeling of turbulence closure, similar to what was presented by Riccardo Balin. Turbulence closure models such as Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes or Large-eddy simulation are used to make the simulations tractable as direct simulations become very expensive for real life applications. The model formulation and coefficients are traditionally determined based on empirical data from idealized flows such as homogenous isotropic flow, that no longer remain valid for unsteady, directional, real life flows.

Hence the task is to train a model based on fully resolved direct simulation or experimental data that can be employed to compute turbulence variable or closure model coefficients directly in a low-fidelity simulation. A method or model that includes temporal dependence such as LSTM or reinforcement learning may be appropriate for this application. the first metric of success would be to perform low fiedlity simulation on the same geometry and operating conditions as a full simulation based on which the model is trained, and having the low fidelity simulation reasonably reproduce the flow field results.
